Description:
FC_Announcer is a highly advanced automatic announcing announcer/broadcast plugin that grants absolute mastery over automatic server announcements. By using FC_Announcer, one is able to create announcements that are viewable only by members with the correct permissions and/or in the proper zone. This control, allows you to create announcements targeting specific groups of players with specific announcements.

This plugin creates what are called “Announcement Groups”, which will be referred to as AGs from here on out, which are quite literally groups of announcements. These AGs require a specific permission to be viewed. To counter inheritance, these announcement groups can also have a specific permission to override being viewed and not be viewed. AGs can also have a zone defined so that players will only see announcements if they have the specific permission and are in the proper zone.

To help clarify exactly what this plugin is intended, and capable of doing, let us go over an example of why you might want to use this plugin. You want to create a jail where jailed players see the rules being repeated over and over again. However, it is imperative that visitors to the jail, aka non-jailed players, do not see these rules. To solve this, you would add announcements to an announcement group. Then, you would define a zone for the announcement group. After ensuring that jailed players have the proper permission to view this announcement group, you would be entirely setup and would now have a jail where jailed players see the rules over and over again, only in the jail, and visitors never see the announcements.

All of this power comes at the convenience of manually edit the configuration files or by using a few commands. As complicated as this plugin may sound, the help page is not even one-page long. Everything is efficient, compact, and powerful and gets the job done effectively.
